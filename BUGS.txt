- Remote capture has not received much testing
- Endian problems with remote capturing and trace files
  - Probably ntohs/ntohl missing in SFF code
  - pcap always stores in host byte order 
    -> need command line argument to change endianess
- There are several functions that expect struct in_addr *,
  but variables are all in_addr_t, which we cast to 
  struct in_addr. Works on tested OS, but may cause
  problems on other OS and may cause issues in future.
