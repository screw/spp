SPP - Synthetic Packet Pairs - Overview

Regular and frequent measurement of round trip time (RTT) between points on the 
Internet is becoming increasingly important for a range of highly interactive 
real-time applications. Active probing techniques are possible but problematic 
The extra packet traffic imposed by active probes along a network path can
modify the behaviour of the network under test. In addition, estimated RTT
results may be misleading if the network handles active probe packets
differently to regular IP packets. 

In contrast, SPP provides frequently updated RTT estmates using IP traffic
already present in the network. SPP estimates the RTT betwen two measurement
points without requiring precise time synchronisation between each point. SPP
accurately estimates the RTT experienced by an application's traffic without
needing modifications to the application itself or the routers along the path.
In addition, SPP works with applications that do not exhibit symmetric
client-server packet exchanges (such as many online multiplayer games) and
applications generating IP multicast traffic.
